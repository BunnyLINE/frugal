Contributing to Frugal
=======================

Creating Pull Requests
----------------------

 - Read the Workiva [Go Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hReRG1wvEZS5BV1H3a9Q4eZV6xV651BF3CfbDVjWMa0)
   document.
 - Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
 - Branch off `develop`, PR back to `develop`.

Reviewing Code
--------------

 - Check out the [guide to high-quality code
   reviews](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b3oJrtdjCOyeH4N5Od0jDmEOT4449SXFiYgNoUOg2io/edit#slide=id.p)
 - We require two +1s on the last commit of every PR before it is merged.
 - If you think a PR could affect security (or Aviary flags the PR as a
   security-related PR), it must also have a separate "security +1" on the last
   commit in addition to two +1s.
    - The security +1 can come from one of the devs who +1'd the PR in the first
      place.
 - To request PRs from the team as a whole, include "@Workiva/messaging-pp" in your
   PR message.
 - At least one of the +1s must come from a full-time Frugal developer.
